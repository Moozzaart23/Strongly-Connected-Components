This code is the first task of the assignmnet. Through his code,we need to find strongly connected components in a directed graph using Depth First search(\+D\+F\+S) algorithm.

This is a recursive function to print D\+FS starting from v \hypertarget{index_func2}{}\doxysubsection{get\+Finishing\+Time(vertices,visited,stack)}\label{index_func2}
This function is mainly used to get the finishing time of the vertices when a D\+FS is implemented on this \mbox{\hyperlink{class_graph}{Graph}} in the form of stack. The top element of stack has the maximum finishing time \hypertarget{index_func3}{}\doxysubsection{add\+Edge(parent,child)}\label{index_func3}
This function is mainly used to add a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v \hypertarget{index_func4}{}\doxysubsection{find\+S\+C\+Cs()}\label{index_func4}
